							<p><h3>5 Surprising Ways to Invest in Your House</h3><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica"><p>For many people, a home is their largest and most important investment. The good news for people around the country is that housing markets continue to appreciate. After the housing crisis several years ago, home values have increased every year.</p>
<p>With <a href="http://www.hgtv.com/design/decorating/design-101/10-tips-to-increase-your-homes-value" rel="nofollow">additional equity</a> in their homes, many people are starting to think about investing money back into their home. There are numerous ways that you can improve the value of your home.</p>
<h2>Expanded Driveway</h2>
<p dir="ltr">One area that <a href="https://www.thisoldhouse.com/driveways/89045/how-to-extend-a-driveway" rel="nofollow">many people</a> never think about changing is their driveway. Over the years, a lot of people have learned that they can expand their driveway to hold more cars. This is especially useful if you have multiple vehicles that members of your family drive.</p>
<p>In the average neighborhood, there is simply not enough space for more than a few cars. It is a small investment to expand the driveway of your home, and the potential future buyers will love this feature.</p>
<h2>New Cabinets</h2>
<p dir="ltr">The kitchen is one of the most important areas of the home when it comes to selling. Cabinets are a central point of any kitchen. If you want to improve or replace your cabinets, it is vital to work with a company that has experience in the field. Look for cabinet refinishing companies near you through online sources.</p>
<p>The cabinets in your kitchen should flow with the rest of your home. With such a large investment of both time and money, make sure that you have conducted research on the best cabinets for your current home.</p>
<h2>Tile in Bathroom</h2>
<p dir="ltr">Another vital room in your home is the master bathroom. You will spend a lot of your time in this room, so it is important to make it as inviting as possible.</p>
<p>Upgrading the floors in your bathroom is a great choice. Tile is the most common piece of material to use. Not only does it last longer, but it looks much better than other options as well.</p>
<p>Heated tile is another feature that many people enjoy. In the cold mornings of the winter, heated tile can be a nice luxury. As soon as you walk on the tile, your feet will be heated and you will enjoy the bathroom experience much more. This is new technology that a lot of people are upgrading to.</p>
<h2>Smart HVAC System</h2>
<p dir="ltr">Everyone knows that a new HVAC system is not cheap. However, there are new HVAC systems that focus on reducing your total energy consumption. Although these units are still expensive, you will save some money every month on lower electricity bills.</p>
<p>With so many options on the market today, it is vital to spend some time finding the right model for your home. If you live in a cold area, make sure the heating unit is large enough to heat your entire home. In many areas, the upstairs part of the home is difficult to heat in the winter without a large unit.</p>
<h2>New Paint</h2>
<p dir="ltr">Perhaps the easiest way to improve the value of your home is to simply paint the walls. New paint on the walls can really improve the look and feel of your home. Although you can do the painting yourself, it makes sense to hire someone who has experience painting.</p>
<p>Painting an <a href="http://www.hgtv.com/remodel/interior-remodel/30-tips-for-increasing-your-homes-value" rel="nofollow">entire house</a> is a long process. Although it will not be cheap, it will improve the value of your home greatly. This is one of the best things to do right before you list a home on the market.</p>
<p>Investing in your home is one of the best financial decisions that you can make. As the housing market continues to improve in value, investing in your home will help you financially. You can even use the equity in your home to pay for the new upgrades that you want.</p></font></td></tr></table></center></td>
